# Exploratory Testing Project for a demo Shopping Cart

I created this repo to showcase how exploratory testing can be performed starting by the definition of a Test Charter, organizing session-based testing with multiple testers and recording observations, defects in a specific [template](https://github.com/mohammed-ibenayad/exploratory_testing_opencart/issues/new/choose).

I have been myself playing multiple roles in this project including the role of the test activities organizer, tester of the shopping cart functionalities according to the scope defined in the [Test Charter](test_charter.md).

# How to contribute to this project ?
If you're a tester and would like to develop your skills in exploratory testing process, please follow the following steps:

1. Read the [Test Charter](test_charter.md) to figure out the different aspects you will need to focus on while testing and outputs you will need to provide.
2. Report your encountered defect using the GitHub issues feature by clicking on create a new issue, and choosing the template **"Bug report for OpenCart report"**
3. Report your test notes using the GitHub issues  feature  by clicking on create a new issue, and choosing the template **"Test notes for OpenCart report"**

:arrow_right: We invite you to use dedicated [GitHub Issues templates](https://github.com/mohammed-ibenayad/exploratory_testing_opencart/issues/new/choose) to log your bugs and test notes.
