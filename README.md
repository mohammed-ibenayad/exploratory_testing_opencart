# Exploratory Testing Project for a demo Shopping Cart

I created this repo to showcase how exploratory testing can be performed starting by the definition of a Test Charter, organizing session-based testing with multiple testers and recording observations, defects in a specific format.

I have been myself playing multiple roles in this project including the role of the test activities organizer, tester of the shopping cart functionalities according to the scope defined in the Test Charter.
